## EFFECTIVE COLLABORATION WITH INFORMATION SHARING IN VIRTUAL UNIVERSITIES

Sharing the information in knowledge based fields like IT has different developers to provide various learning systems with low cost. While a variety of e-learning advantages has been recognized for a long time and many advances in e-learning systems have been implemented, the needs for effective information sharing in a secure manner have till date been largely ignored, especially for virtual university collaborative environments. Even though there is possibility to share information which is not secured. So, the information sharing of virtual universities usually occurs in broad, highly dynamic network-based environments and formally accessing the resources in secure manner posses a difficult and vital challenge. This project aims to build a new regulation-based framework to recognize and tackle issues of distributed in virtual university environments through role-based access control management. The framework includes a role-based group delegation granting model, group delegation revocation model, authorization granting and authorization revocation.
We have different modules in this application, they are

1)	Management

2)	Students

3)	Role Delegation

4)	Role Revocation

5)	Uploading and Downloading materials


# Module 1: Management:

Management of a particular university can add professors from their university, can view other universities and can also view professors of other universities. Management has access to view students who are registered and can view queries that are asked by the registered students. It can also view materials that are shared. 

The admin can add Universities, and can delete universities which are not authenticated, admin also has the right to view materials, students, queries and has the right to answer the queries and assign the Job requested and can generate status of the status requested for the registration and professors requested for role revocation.

After becoming a valid user, they can view their profile, professors, universities and professors of other virtual universities. They can also update their profile. They can download materials that are shared by different universities. If they have any doubts regarding the subjects they can post the queries and view answers that are posted by the professors. They can also add feedback regarding any improvements that have to be done.  

# Module 3: Role Delegation:

Professors who are not available at a particular period of time can assign his/her role to a person with same qualification or bellowed qualification, can request to accept his role as a professor or lecture and can view the response if he has accepted or not.
